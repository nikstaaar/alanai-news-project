# Alan News App

Alan News is a voice-controlled news application that leverages Alan AI to fetch and read news articles aloud. It provides an intuitive interface for users to access news content using voice commands. The app is built using React and integrates Alan AI for voice interaction. Additionally, it utilizes Material-UI (MUI) for the layout design, although note that the `mui/styles` package had to be uninstalled due to compatibility issues with React 18.
